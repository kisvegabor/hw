# Periphery and device drivers
asd
This Hardware Library is written mainly for the Littlev Graphics Library. If you would like to create GUI for an embedded system you should visit its [repository](https://github.com/littlevgl/lvgl) or [website](http://www.gl.littlev.hu).

The repository contains some drivers for microcontroller (and PC) peripheries like:
* GPIO
* UART
* SPI
* I2C
* TFT
* etc

And for devices like:
* Display controllers: e.g. SSD1963
* Touch pad controllers: e.g. XPT2046
* LED
* Buzzer
* etc

There are drivers for different microcontroller families and even for PC. You can easily change between families by modifying a define in *hw_conf.h*
because all drivers use the same API.

Currently mainly PIC microcontrollers and PC are supported:
* PIC24F/33E
* PIC32MX
* PIC32MZ
* PC

## Usage
1. Clone the repository into the root folder of your project: `git clone https://github.com/littlevgl/hw.git`
2. In your IDE add the project **root folder as include path**
3. Copy *hw/hw_conf_templ.h* as **hw_conf.h** to the project root folder
4. Delete the first `#if 0` and the last `#endif` to enable the file
5. Choose the hardware family by: `#define PSP_...   1`
6. Enable/disable or configure the components
7. To initialize the library `#include hw/hw.h` and call `per_init()` and `dev_init()`

## Remark
It is not the goal of this library to create drivers for all peripheries and functions. 
When I use a new microcontroller and a new periphery I will add it. 

If you are using the library in your project pleas write your drivers according to the existing ones and share them! :)
